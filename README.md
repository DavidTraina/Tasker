# Tasker

Tasker is a very simple to-do list web app made with Docker Compose, Flask, Jinja, Python, and PostgreSQL.
Tasker was created to teach myself the basics of Docker and Docker Compose.


## Usage

With [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) installed, clone this repo.
At the root directory, build the images and run the containers in the background by executing
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
Tasker will now be running at [http://localhost:5000/](http://localhost:5000/)
